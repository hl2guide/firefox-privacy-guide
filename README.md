# 1.0 Introduction

This guide has been written to help people switch to **Mozilla Firefox** with the best settings, addons (extensions) etc.

Internet browser security, privacy and adblocking has been drastically impacted recently.

The affected browsers are:

* All chromium-based Browsers (most common browsers)
    * Google Chrome
    * Microsoft Edge
    * Vivaldi
    * Brave
    * Opera

This is due to Google implementing a far more restictive standard on internet browser extensions called **Manifest V3**.

I recommend using **Mozilla Firefox** to avoid all of the limitations, complications and side-effects of this debacle.

# 1.1 Installing Firefox for Desktop

(By desktop I am using it in the loosest meaning so it includes the majority of laptops and notebooks too.)

**Mozilla Firefox** is available for _Microsoft Windows_, _macOS_ and _Linux_.

Be sure to download it from the official download site at: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/desktop-release/

On that page you can select a *Platform*, the appropriate *Language* and the download the installer.

This guide will focus on Windows 11 since that is the platform I use.

So as an example I select `Windows 64-bit` as the platform and `English (British) - English (British)` as the language.

On the resulting page click the big blue `Download Now` button and then run the file once downloaded.

üìù Note: If you use another platform please refer to the install instructions on Mozilla Firefox's website.

# 1.3 Addons

Addons (Firefox's name for a browser extension) extend the capabilities of the browser adding features.

These are my personal recommended must-install addons:

* [Decentraleyes by Thomas Rientjes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)
* [Privacy Badger by EFF Technologists](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/)
* [uBlock Origin by Raymond Hill](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)

These are nice to have if you watch **YouTube.com**:

* [DeArrow - Better Titles and Thumbnails on YouTube by Ajay](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/dearrow/)
* [Return YouTube Dislike by Dmitry Selivanov](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/return-youtube-dislikes/)

* [Video Resumer by Appteligent LTD](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/video-resumer/)

# 1.6 FAQ

## Why not use Firefox derivitives like LibreWolf?

In my experience these derivitives frequently delay updates and do not update `point updates` therefore risking security.
