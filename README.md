# 1.0 Introduction

This guide has been written to help people switch to **Mozilla Firefox** with the best settings, addons (extensions) etc.

Internet browser security, privacy and adblocking has been drastically impacted recently.

The affected browers are:

* Chromium-based Browsers (most common browsers)
    * Google Chrome
    * Microsoft Edge
    * Vivaldi
    * Brave
    * Opera

This is due to Google implementing a far more restictive standard on brower extensions called **manifest V3**.

I recommend using **Mozilla Firefox** to avoid all of the limitations, complications and side-effects of this debacle.

# 1.1 Installing Firefox for Desktop

**Mozilla Firefox** is available for _Microsoft Windows_, _macOS_ and _Linux_.

The official download site: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/desktop-release/

On that page you can select a *Platform*, the appropriate *Language* and the download the installer.

This guide will focus on Windows 11 since that is the platform I use.

If you use another platform please refer to the install instructions on Firefox's website.
