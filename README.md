# 1.0 Introduction

This guide has been written to help people switch to **Mozilla Firefox** with the best settings, addons (extensions) etc.

Internet browser security, privacy and adblocking has been drastically impacted recently.

The affected browsers are:

* Chromium-based Browsers (most common browsers)
    * Google Chrome
    * Microsoft Edge
    * Vivaldi
    * Brave
    * Opera

This is due to Google implementing a far more restictive standard on internet browser extensions called **Manifest V3**.

I recommend using **Mozilla Firefox** to avoid all of the limitations, complications and side-effects of this debacle.

# 1.1 Installing Firefox for Desktop

By desktop I am using it in the loosest meaning so it includes the majority of laptops and notebooks too.

**Mozilla Firefox** is available for _Microsoft Windows_, _macOS_ and _Linux_.

Be sure to download it from the official download site at: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/desktop-release/

On that page you can select a *Platform*, the appropriate *Language* and the download the installer.

This guide will focus on Windows 11 since that is the platform I use.

So as an example I select `Windows 64-bit` as the platform and `English (British) - English (British)` as the language.

On the resulting page click the big blue `Download Now` button and then run the file once downloaded.

üìù Note: If you use another platform please refer to the install instructions on Mozilla Firefox's website.

# 1.3 Addons

These are my personal suggested must-install addons:

* Decentraleyes
* Privacy Badger
* uBlock Origin

These are nice to have if you watch **YouTube**:

* DeArrow
* Return YouTube Dislike
* SponsorBlock for YouTube - Skip Sponsorships
* Video Resumer

These are nice to have if you watch **Twitch**:

* TTV LOL PRO
* Unwanted Twitch
